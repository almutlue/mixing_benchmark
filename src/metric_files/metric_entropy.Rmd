## Shannon's entropy

Metric calculating the Shannon's entropy of the batch/group variable within each cell's k-nearest neigbours.
Shannon's entropy can be written as: $$entropy = -\sum_{i=1}^{n}p(x_i)*\log(p(x_i))$$.
Thereby $p(x_i)$ describes the probability of *batch i* in the neighborhood of a specific cell. This probability is the proportion of the observed number of cells from each batch within the knn. We divide each cell's Shannon's entropy by $\log(\#batches)$ to ensure a value in $[0:1]$.
