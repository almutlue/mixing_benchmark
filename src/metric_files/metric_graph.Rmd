## Graph connectivity 
Modified and adapted from [Luecken et al, 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.22.111161v1)

The graph connectivity metric assesses whether the kNN graph representation $G$ of the
data directly connects all cells with the same cell identity label. For each cell identity
label $c$, a subset kNN graph $G(N_c;E_c)$ was created to contain only cells from a given label. 
Within these celltype specific subset kNN graphs the graph connectivity score is defined as the 
mean fraction of directly within the longest connected component ($LCC$) connected cells within each celltype graph:
$$gc = \frac{1}{|c|}\sum_{c \in C}\frac{LCC(G(N_c;E_c))}{N_c}$$
